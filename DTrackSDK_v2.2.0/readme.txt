Purpose of DTrackSDK
--------------------

A set of functions to provide an interface to A.R.T. tracking systems. It supports
both DTrack and DTrack2. 
The functions receive and process DTrack/DTrack2 measurement data packets (UDP; ASCII),
and send/exchange DTrack/DTrack2 command strings (UDP/TCP; ASCII).



How to receive and process A.R.T. tracking data
-----------------------------------------------

DTrack/DTrack2 uses ethernet (UDP/IP datagrams) to send measurement data to other
applications. They both use an ASCII data format.
In its most simple operating mode DTrackSDK is just receiving and processing these data. In
this case DTrackSDK just needs to know the port number where the data are arriving; all necessary
settings have to be done manually in the DTrack/DTrack2 frontend software.

DTrack/DTrack2 also provides a way to control the tracking system through a command interface via
ethernet. Both DTrack and DTrack2 use ASCII command strings. DTrack2 commands are sent via a
TCP/IP connection.

The formats and all other necessary definitions are described in
'ARTtrack & DTrack(2) Manual: Technical Appendix'.



Sample source codes for an own interface
----------------------------------------

The sample source code files show how to use the DTrackSDK:

	example_without_remote_control.cpp:       sample without usage of remote commands (C++)
	example_with_simple_remote_control.cpp:   simple dtrack/dtrack2 sample with usage of remote commands (C++)
	example_with_dtrack2_remote_control.cpp:  dtrack2 sample with usage of remote commands (C++)
	example_listen_to_multicast.cpp:          multicast sample without usage of remote commands (C++)

Each example uses a different constructor and explains how to use it.

All examples are written in C++, and work for both Unix and Windows. The files have been
successfully tested under Linux, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

For Windows: please link with library 'ws2_32.lib'.



Compatibility with older SDK versions
-------------------------------------

DTrackSDK comes with additional sources that should make it easier to upgrade from older SDK
versions. Actually they are just wrappers around class 'DTrackSDK', and allow to use the known
interface. They are available for the classes:

	DTracklib:  class only for DTrack systems (C++; used from May 2005 until Dec 2006)
	DTrack:     class only for DTrack systems (C++; used from Jan 2007 until Dec 2010)
	DTrack2:    class only for DTrack2 systems (C++; used from May 2008 until Dec 2010)

Note that the wrappers just work for the C++ SDK versions; there's no wrapper for the 'dtracklib'
SDK written in C.
